  //     A map is a generalized array that consists of key-value-pairs. While
  //     the keys in
  // an ordinary array are always the consecutive integers 0,1,...,nâˆ’1, where n
  // is the size of the array, the keys in a map can be of any data type and
  // they do not have to be consecutive values. The C++ standard library
  // contains two map implementations that correspond to the set
  // implementations: the structure map is based on a balanced binary tree and
  // accessing elements takes O(logn) time, while the structure unordered_map
  // uses hashing and accessing elements takes O(1) time on average.

  cout << m["one"] << " "; // 1
  //     If the value of a key is requested but the map does not contain it, the
  //     key
  // is automatically added to the map with a default value. For example, in the
  // following code, the key four with value 0 is added to the map
  cout << m["four"]; // 0 and four is added to the map
  // check if key is exist in the map
  if (m.count("one"))
    cout << "exist";

         << ' '; // first is the key and second is the value of the key

  // shortest way
  for (auto x : m)
    cout << x.first << ' ' << x.second;

  // find element using iterator
  auto it = m.find("one");
